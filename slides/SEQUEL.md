# 💻 Open Source Contributions, Part 2
(Optional)

## 💬 Retrospective

<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>
- Very few students were able to get a bug resolved (Not your fault! ❤️)
- Difficult for students to find _good_ good-first-bugs
- Project maintainers were slow to respond
</details>

## 🥇 Benefits

- Contributing to an open source project is a great way to impress recruiters / interviewers
- Good practice for onboarding into a big repo
- Feels good to contribute to something people actually use
- Networking opportunities with professional software engineers

## 🦊 Mozilla Focus

- I've found that the best way to get a first contribution over the finish line is to have a couple maintainers within the project
- There are several Mozilla employees who have prior experience mentoring first vontributors, and there is a very active community of external contributors for Mozilla
- I (Finn) will work with my colleages to curate a list of actually good good-first-bugs, and recruit other Mozilla employees to help mentor
- As it turns out, Mozilla employees have complained that there are many good-first-bugs that no one is picking up, so there's plenty of supply!

## ✅ Next Steps

- I (Finn) will make myself available for continued assistance on open source contributions
- Availability will be async over Discord / [Matrix](https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Matrix&mobileaction=toggle_view_mobile)
- I will also make myself available for Zoom office hours
- This is **OPTIONAL**. If you are interested, please fill out [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/VB7ywU6ceyYg4tQJA) by **11:59pm on Friday, Feb 23**
- I know you have other commitments on your time, between interviewing for internships and starting the spring semester. I'm expecting this to take approximately 2-3 hours per week of your time
- It will start on February 2, and go through March 9
- Goal is to get _at least_ one bug resolved.
